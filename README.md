Bop
===

A Discord Bot that plays YouTube Music.

**This is for educational purposes only. You should not use this.**

# How to use this

1. Get your bot's token from [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

2. Create a `.env` in this directory and put in `DISCORD_TOKEN=YOURTOKEN`

3. In your application panel, click OAuth2, then under OAuth2 URL Generator select `bot` and `applications.commands`, then copy that URL for later.

4. Run `npm install` in this directory. You should probably have `ffmpeg` installed globally as well.

5. Run `node index.js`

If everything works, you should see a message that says `Bop is ready!`.

# Commands

`!bop play industry baby by lil nas x`

`!bop pause`

`!bop resume`

# Troubleshooting

This sort of app could fail for many reasons. It's all very complicated. I don't have a huge FAQ for you but if you want me to personally help you get this running locally for educational purposes, then consider joining the discord below.
